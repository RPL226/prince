# PRINCE cipher for ARM Cortex M4

This project is to implement the PRINCE lightweight symmetric block cipher for ARM Cortex M4 devices in assembly. We want to construct a version hardened against differential power analysis and to evaluate its performance against the unprotected version.

## Status

Currently we have a reference Python version and no asm yet.
